# Logitech MeetUp Privacy Shutter/Lens Cover

Since the Logitech MeetUp conference camera doesn't come with a privacy shutter I decided to make one, with front on a hinge so it can be opened and closed without removing the whole thing. If you're zoomed out and pan it's possible for it to be in frame, but it's not a problem for me depsite quite a lot of pan but also some zoom.

The hinge works by inserting a piece of 1.75mm filament (and melting the ends, not sure if necessary). Depending on your printer You may need to file the side of the hinge for it to move smoothly, and you may well need to drill out the bore for the hinge filament.

I've included the OpenSCAD file if you need to adjust fit around the camera, how far it sticks out, or enlarge the hinge holes for example.
